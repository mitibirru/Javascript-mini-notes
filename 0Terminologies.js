/*
    1. Why do we use the word “debugger” in javascript?
->  The debugger for the browser must be activated in order to debug the code. Built-in
    debuggers may be switched on and off, requiring the user to report faults. The
    remaining section of the code should stop execution before moving on to the next
    line while debugging.

    2. Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.
->  Both are comparison operators. The difference between both the operators is that
    “==” is used to compare values whereas, “ === “ is used to compare both values and
    types.

    3. Difference between var and let keyword in javascript.
->  Some differences are
        1. From the very beginning, the 'var' keyword was used in JavaScript programming
        whereas the keyword 'let' was just added in 2015.
        2. The keyword 'Var' has function scope. Anywhere in the function, the variable
        specified using var is accessible but in ‘let’ the scope of a variable declared with
        the 'let' keyword is limited to the block in which it is declared. Let's start with a
        Block Scope.
        3. 'var' declares a variable that will be hoisted but 'let' declares a variable that will
        be not hoisted.
